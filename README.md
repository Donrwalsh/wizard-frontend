## General setup notes

* Made repo in github, using lists with a bookmark to combine multiple repos.
* Using VSCode.
* I used https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html to set up git on my machine for the first time.
* As a challenge, I'd like to do command line git only and not lean on a gui for it.

## Frontend specific notes

* Going to start with basic html/js/css to play around with some stuff before making decisions on how to build.
* Tried a circular spell button, but I think that shape limits showing progress of the element too much. Going to try with a more square-ish version.
